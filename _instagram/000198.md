caption: 'Fresh snow! After the first mile or so on the #northbranchtrail the conditions
  were so perfect, I turned off all of my lights and rode in darkness. As my eyes
  adjusted I could see everything, and it was so quiet with the fresh snow...It was
  beautiful beyond description. #fatbike #lovestarbicyclebags #bikepackingbags #bikepacking

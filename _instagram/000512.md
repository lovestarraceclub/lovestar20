caption: 'The Lovestar workbench. Every single Lovestar bag has been made using one
  of these two machines. The black one is a 1948 Singer featherweight 221-1 that was
  originally an engagement present from my grandfather to my grandmother. The white
  machine is a 1963 Singer Feather weight 221K and belonged to my other grandmother.
  When you buy a handmade product, you are able to own something that has a story
  all it&apos;s own before it even gets used. Every Lovestar product is Steeped in
  my own family history just by the nature of the tools I use. As a craftsman, these
  tools give me an enormous connection to the bags I make, and offers a intimate and
  personal touch to my work that makes every Lovestar big unique. #handmade #lovestarbicyclebags

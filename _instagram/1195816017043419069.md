caption: 'Shortly before I said farewell to REI, I had the opportunity to be a part
  of a photo shoot for the @rei 2016 Novara catalogue. They outfitted me with a bike,
  sent a camera crew and followed me around while I rode around the North Shore. It
  was a fun experience...and today I was able to snag a copy of the finished product.
  Some custom #lovestarbicyclebags that I had made for the bike were featured along
  with @otherbrothercoffee who graciously hosted me and the camera crew on the morning
  of the shoot. #REI #Novara #cycling #bikecommute #bikechi'

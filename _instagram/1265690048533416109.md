  Dirty Kanza 200! Special thanks and so much love to my wife, Roberta for supporting
  all my crazy training!! Big shout out to @casadewaggoner and @elliotlovestarbicycles
  for doing this with me, sorry your days didn&apos;t end the way you hoped! :-( Big
  thank you to Matt for being our support crew. And special thanks to @ponylou and
  the crew at #ponyshop for making sure my bike was in tip top shape. And finally,
  special thanks to David Englund for teaching how to keep going when it feels like
  I&apos;ve got nothing left. #lovestarfactoryteam #crushgravel #dk200 #superx'

caption: 'Sometimes you learn more about yourself in defeat than in victory. I had
  planned on racing the 63 mile route today but I just wasn&apos;t prepared mentally
  for the race today. Punishing winds broke me open &amp;amp; I just couldn&apos;t
  finish my planned route. I finished the shorter 35 mile route, but felt brutalize
  the entire way. i had debated about even racing today - it had been a long weekend
  away from my family, and that isn&apos;t a great place to be when you step up to
  the start line. overall it was a great learning experience and a humbling ride.

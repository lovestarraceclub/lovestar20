caption: '#babyARC was up most of last night feeling sick &amp;amp; sad. After a tough
  morning, I just bundled him up and we went for a ride, he passed out after the first
  100 feet...so we rode around for an hour until he woke up. Fresh air and sunshine
  are good medicine. #outsideisfree #optoutside #cycling #fatbike #lovestarbicyclebags'

  The 2017 Barry Roubaix was wet and rainy with average temps hovering around 34 degrees.\
  \ I finished my ride, and through poor planning on my part, was left outside waiting\
  \ for a teammate who had the car keys. I was soaked, borderline hypothermic, tired\
  \ and rather miserable...so in desperation, I ventured inside ACE hArdware to try\
  \ and warm up and stay out of the rain. I stood in the entryway covered in mud,\
  \ dripping water, visibly shaking from the cold...as I stood there, other cyclists\
  \ who were in a similar situation started to gather in the entryway with me.\nNow,\
  \ anytime you have an event like this, where 3500 cyclists converge on a small town\
  \ and take it over for a day, there are many reasons for local residents and businesses\
  \ to begrudge &quot;tourists&quot; like myself. I had this in mind as I tracked\
  \ my muddy footprints into the store. As the group of muddy road-weary cyclists\
  \ gathered by the heater inside the ACE entryway, I began to expect that a store\
  \ manager would soon be sent over to ask us to move along, and I wouldn&apos;t have\
  \ blamed them. \nHowever...\nThe staff at ACE Hardware not only welcomed me (and\
  \ all the other cyclists) but they checked in on us regularly to ask if we needed\
  \ anything. Then the store staff set up a keurig coffee machine and started serving\
  \ us hot drinks to try and help us warm up. There was no rush to get us out of the\
  \ store, or any sense of annoyance at our muddy invasion of their business space.\
  \ Just genuine goodwill. I have a local ACE hardware in my hometown of Evanston\
  \ IL that will now be my primary hardware store, and my future trips to Barry Roubaix\
  \ will most certainly include a stop at the Hastings ACE. This store was a shining\
  \ example of a local business going way above and beyond. \nThank you to that store\
  \ team for taking such good care of us...it was appreciated more than you know.\

caption: 'Worked at Bike the Drive this morning. My day stared around 2:30am...saw
  a beautiful sunrise over Lake Michigan, got to ride a small section of a car-free
  Lake Shore Drive, saw some killer fat bikes from @wisemanframeworks and helped a
  lot of people get out on bikes today. All in all not a bad way to spend a day. #bikethedrive

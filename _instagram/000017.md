caption: 'It&apos;s been a rough couple weeks for my cycling. Off the bike a lot with
  illness, sick kids, cold-wet &amp;amp; dark weather...this morning I got up early
  for a garage roller session to start getting my legs back under me. Felt really
  good in a horrifying painful kind of way. #cycling #bicycle #lovestarraceclub'

caption: 'Finished up a fun custom #LovestarBicycleBags frame bag today. Deep purple
  to match the old-school-cool acid wash paint on this vintage Ross. Mixed in some
  Red highlights to compliment the overall color pallet on the bike. The entire bag
  is made of 1000D #Cordura so it should last the owner another 20 years. #handmade

caption: 'Bike commuting for the last 8+ years, I&apos;ve developed pretty thick skin
  when it comes to driver road rage. But some days, it can still just set you off
  in a way that threatens to ruin a ride. One of the benefits of commuting via fat
  bike, is that you can turn off the route and explore less travelled pathways...today&apos;s
  exploring turned a seething road rage ride into a relaxed &amp;amp; scenic adventure.
  Life is too short to let others ruin the things you love...so here&apos;s to the
  road less travelled. #bikecommute #fatbike #bikechi #bicycle #cyclist #cycling #lovestarbicyclebags

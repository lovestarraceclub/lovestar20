caption: 'So...race was tough yesterday, I was feeling good, but about half way through
  the race I botched a barrier landing and crashed hard. I was able to grit through
  it and finished 34th, but my leg was killing me an felt really weak. Went to the
  Dr. today and turns out I have a partial tear in my right quad. Gonna miss the next
  couple of races...but I should be able to finish out the latter part of the season.

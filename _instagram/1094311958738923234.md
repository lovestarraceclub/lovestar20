caption: 'Took the road whip out today. But the day was so beautiful, I found myself
  coasting on the downhills, stopping to take pictures, exploring detours, and just
  soaking in the gorgeousness of fall. Sometimes it&apos;s best to skip a training
  day. #cycling #cylist #bikechi #lovestarfactoryteam'

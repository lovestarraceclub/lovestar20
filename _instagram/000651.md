caption: 'Maiden voyage on the new Motobecane today. Considering I bought this bike
  as a cost-effective (relatively speaking of course!) straight from the internet
  all weather/commuter bike, I&apos;m pleasantly surprised at how solid it is. Major
  kudos to @elliotlovestarbicycles for helping me assemble, lube, and adjust all the
  critical stuff. A few tweaks and upgrades and this will be a killer winter machine!!

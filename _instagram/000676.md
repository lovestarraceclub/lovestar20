caption: 'Muddy race today. #lovestarfactoryteam had a day with some extreme highs
  and lows. Several top 10 finishes from our juniors team and our full sized squad.
  But we had one team mate leave in an ambulance. Wishing him well and hoping for
  a speedy recovery. Thanks to @highergearbikes for putting on a great race! #cyclocross

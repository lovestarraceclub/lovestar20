caption: 'To date I have worked exclusively on Singer featherweight machines. The
  white one is circa 1963 and the black one 1947. These are amazing machines clearly
  made in a different era when  products were made to be serviced an cared for over
  the span of multiple generations. Both of these machines have deep personal history
  in my family, and will probably still be humming away long after I am gone. #sometimestheoldwaysarebest
